    <p>China remains a mostly unfree economy. The modest improvements in its economic freedom score in recent years have resulted mostly from gains in the property rights, judicial effectiveness, and business freedom indicators. Overall, the economic freedom that does exist in China continues to lack depth and breadth, and the government needs to ensure that business-friendly policy changes are understood and implemented nationwide, not just in Beijing or the major commercial centers</p>

    <p>  China has one of the world’s largest economies and is the world’s biggest exporter, but its per capita income is below the global average. A slowdown in economic growth that may be more severe than is officially acknowledged poses serious challenges both for the government and for Xi’s ideological economic framework. China’s relations with the U.S. and its allies have worsened since the start of the ongoing trade war and particularly since the advent of COVID-19.</p>

    <p>Protection of property rights remains weak. All land in China is owned either by the state or by rural collectives. Land seizures are common. Theft of foreign-owned intellectual property is widespread. The Communist Party dominates the subservient judicial system. Corruption remains endemic at all levels of government, and anecdotal information suggests that the government’s crackdown on corruption is applied inconsistently and discretionarily.</p>
